# Python-Project-Smartprix-Laptops
<h1>Smartprix Laptop Data Analysis Project</h1>

<p>This repository hosts an end-to-end Python project focused on analyzing laptops listed on the <strong>Smartprix</strong> website.</p>

<h2> Project Overview</h2>

<h3> Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>The dataset undergoes thorough data cleaning, which includes handling missing values, generating new features, and ensuring overall data consistency. Several columns contain NaN values; notably, the rating column has the most missing entries. These values are preserved for future analysis.</p>

<h3> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
<p>EDA is conducted to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. The analysis explores aspects such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Warranty distribution</li>
  <li>RAM and ROM preferences</li>
  <li>Operating system usage patterns</li>
  <li>CPU and GPU combinations and their price/rating impact</li>
  <li>Core count influence on pricing and ratings</li>
</ul>

<h2> Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identification of outlier prices.</li>
  <li>Touchscreen and Gaming features narrow price ranges.</li>
  <li>Apple and Microsoft laptops are the most expensive brands.</li>
  <li>Positive correlation between RAM size and laptop price.</li>
  <li>Preference for DDR4 RAM and SSD storage across brands.</li>
  <li>NVIDIA and Intel combinations dominate higher-priced laptops.</li>
  <li>Higher core counts generally correlate with higher values.</li>
  <li>Longer warranty periods contribute to higher pricing.</li>
  <li>Mac OS laptops command premium prices, while Windows OS dominates model availability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Touchscreen and Gaming Impact:</strong> Laptops with both Touchscreen and gaming features show narrower price variations, indicating greater value consistency. Gaming laptops without Touchscreen feature broader price variability.</p>

<p><strong>Brand Pricing Trends:</strong> Apple and Microsoft lead as premium-priced brands, while HP, Dell, Asus, Samsung, and Acer cater to more budget-friendly segments.</p>

<p><strong>Operating System Influence:</strong> macOS laptops hold higher price points, whereas Windows OS remains the most common choice across manufacturers, especially for gaming laptops.</p>

<p><strong>RAM and ROM Preferences:</strong> DDR4 RAM and SSD storage dominate, reflecting modern performance-oriented trends.</p>

<p><strong>GPU and CPU Combinations:</strong> NVIDIA GPUs paired with Intel CPUs commonly appear in high-priced models, indicating performance and premium positioning.</p>

<p><strong>Core Count Analysis:</strong> Increased core count positively correlates with higher prices and improved ratings.</p>

<p><strong>Warranty Considerations:</strong> Laptops offering longer warranty periods are priced higher, underscoring consumer value perception.</p>

<h2> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The project concludes by summarizing the findings and highlighting potential areas for further investigation</p>
<h3>This project demonstrates Python-based data cleaning and EDA with Pandas and NumPy, revealing key insights into the laptop market</h3>
